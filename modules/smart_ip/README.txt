Description:
Smart IP identify visitor's geographical location (longitude/latitude), country, region, city and postal code based on
the IP address of the user. These information will be stored at session variable ($_SESSION) with array key 'smart_ip'
and Drupal user data service using the parameters 'smart_ip' as 'module' and 'geoip_location' as 'name' of the user but
optionally it can  be disabled (by role) at Smart IP admin page. Other modules can use the function
\Drupal\smart_ip\SmartIp::query($ipAddress) that returns an array containing the visitor's ISO 3166 2-character country
code, longitude, latitude, region, city and postal code. It provides a feature for you to perform your own IP lookup and
admin spoofing of an arbitrary IP for testing purposes.

Requirements:
Drupal 8.x
geoip2/geoip2 library (if using MaxMind as data source)
ip2location/ip2location-php library (if using IP2Location as data source)
