The GridStack sample requires a "field_image" normally at Article content type
and automatically created when using Standard profile.

If no "field_image", just create a field named "Image". Otherwise won't install,
or empty images.

Adjust anything, clone and make it yours:
admin/structure/views/view/gridstack_x/edit

The samples are not "responsive" by default. However you can drag and drop
grid boxes to build responsive layouts just as easily with the provided options.
Too many possibilities to build responsive boxes to your heart contents, and
that is why they are left there as is for your own excercise.
